### salary-prediction-portfolio
 
In this project I had some data about job postings with salaries that I used to build a model that would predict salaries for other job postings.

I am completing this project in Pyton using Jupyter Notebook and you can view my code here on github -> [Salay-Project](https://github.com/cdean4/salary-prediction-portfolio/blob/master/SalaryProject.ipynb)
